# Creating Rich Dashboard Experiences with jQuery

This repository contains the code samples used in the [Infragistics](http://www.infragistics.com) webinar **Creating Rich Dashboard Experiences with jQuery**.

## Structure
The the `javascript` folder includes the code required to run the example without the dependency of any server side platform. The `mvc` folder includes a Visual Studio solution that makes use of the [Ignite UI](http://www.igniteui.com) [ASP.NET MVC helpers](http://www.igniteui.com/help/iggrid-developing-asp-net-mvc-applications-with-iggrid) to create the same demo.
